Convert OpenAPI specifications into [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/) format - structured markdown documentation that minimizes context size for AI agents.

AI agents often need domain-specific knowledge to complete tasks. Rather than writing custom prompts or building MCP tools from scratch, leveraging existing API documentation is a practical approach - and OpenAPI is the de facto standard with battle-tested specifications maintained over years.

However, feeding raw OpenAPI specs to agents has limitations. Complex specifications can exceed LLM context limits, and even when they fit, loading the entire document for every request wastes valuable context.

Agent Skills solves this by structuring documentation for on-demand reading. Agents load only what they need - starting with an overview, then drilling into specific operations or schemas. Since file reading is a universal capability across agent frameworks, this approach works everywhere without special integrations.

## What's New in This Fork

Since forking from upstream, the following features have been added, modified, or removed:

### Added

- **Inline request/response schema rendering** — Operations with inline (non-`$ref`) request bodies and responses now render as full field tables. Previously, inline objects were silently dropped — only `$ref`-based schemas appeared in output.
- **Nested `allOf` object display** — Fields using `allOf` schema composition resolve `$ref` sub-schemas inline, showing child fields directly in the parent schema table.
- **Auto-generated schema examples** — Schema and operation documents now include example JSON generated from `example` / `examples` fields in the spec.

### Removed

- **Description truncation** — API description no longer truncated to 200 characters; resource descriptions no longer truncated to 50 characters.

## Features

- **Semantic structure** - Output organized by resources, operations, and schemas, enabling agents to load only relevant sections
- **Smart grouping** - Operations grouped by tags or path prefix (auto-detected), schemas grouped by naming prefix
- **Filtering** - Include/exclude by tags, paths, or deprecated status
- **Customizable templates** - Override default Eta templates for custom output format

## Usage

```bash
npx openapi-to-skills ./openapi.yaml -o ./output
# or
bunx openapi-to-skills ./openapi.yaml -o ./output
# or from URL
npx openapi-to-skills https://example.com/openapi.yaml -o ./output
```

### Options

| Option                 | Alias | Description                                                          |
| ---------------------- | ----- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--output`             | `-o`  | Output directory (default: `./output`)                               |
| `--name`               | `-n`  | Skill name (default: derived from API title)                         |
| `--include-tags`       |       | Only include specified tags (comma-separated)                        |
| `--exclude-tags`       |       | Exclude specified tags (comma-separated)                             |
| `--exclude-paths`      |       | Exclude paths matching prefixes (comma-separated)                    |
| `--exclude-deprecated` |       | Exclude deprecated operations                                        |
| `--group-by`           | `-g`  | How to group operations: `tags`, `path`, or `auto` (default: `auto`) |
| `--case-strategy`      |       | Strategy for case-insensitive filesystem safety: `lowercase`         |
| `--templates`          | `-t`  | Custom templates directory                                           |
| `--force`              | `-f`  | Overwrite existing output directory                                  |
| `--quiet`              | `-q`  | Suppress output except errors                                        |

### Case-Insensitive Filesystem Safety

Some OpenAPI specs define schemas whose names differ only in letter casing (e.g., `alert` and `Alert`). This produces output directories that collide on case-insensitive filesystems (macOS, Windows), causing one to silently overwrite the other.

Use `--case-strategy lowercase` to avoid this:

```bash
npx openapi-to-skills ./openapi.yaml -o ./output --case-strategy lowercase
```

This lowercases all schema output paths and disambiguates collisions with numeric suffixes (e.g., `alert.md` and `alert-2.md`). Without this option, the original casing is preserved (default behavior, no breaking change).

### Output Structure

```
{skill-name}/
  SKILL.md                 # Entry point with API overview
  references/
    resources/             # One file per tag
    operations/            # One file per operation
    schemas/               # Grouped by naming prefix
    authentication.md      # Auth schemes (if any)
```

### External References

If your OpenAPI spec contains external `$ref` references (e.g., `./common.yaml#/components/schemas/Error`), bundle them first:

```bash
npx swagger-cli bundle ./api.yaml -o ./bundled.yaml
npx openapi-to-skills ./bundled.yaml -o ./output
```

## Programmatic API

The package exports `convertOpenAPIToSkill` for integration into build pipelines or custom tooling:

```typescript
import { convertOpenAPIToSkill } from "openapi-to-skills";

const spec = {
  /* OpenAPI spec object */
};

await convertOpenAPIToSkill(spec, {
  outputDir: "./output",
  parser: {
    skillName: "my-api",
    filter: {
      includeTags: ["users", "orders"],
      excludeDeprecated: true,
    },
  },
});
```

For advanced use cases, individual components (`createParser`, `createRenderer`, `createWriter`) are also exported.

## Examples

### Petstore (simple)

See [examples/](./examples) for a simple demo with the classic Petstore spec (3 resources, 19 operations).

### Public APIs Collection (production-scale)

[public-api-skills](https://github.com/Yuyz0112/public-api-skills) demonstrates real-world usage across a large collection of public APIs:

| Metric     | Original           | Agent Skills           |
| ---------- | ------------------ | ---------------------- |
| Source     | 1 file (7.2 MB)    | 2,135 files            |
| Resources  | -                  | 77 index files         |
| Operations | 588 (all in one)   | 588 individual files   |
| Schemas    | 1,315 (all in one) | 1,468 individual files |

A 7.2 MB monolithic spec becomes 2,135 focused files that agents can navigate on-demand.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Detect unresolved external `$ref` and warn users
- [x] Support fetching OpenAPI specs from URL
